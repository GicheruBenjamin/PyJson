## Intro 
Json is a good data format for interchange across systems. 
It makes it possible for apis that maybe built in different prog languages be able to communicate.
In this repo I do Showcase the ability of Python to deal with Json data.  

## CRUD operation 
Create :- one can create a .json file and add json data into it.
Read :- one can read .json file and get json data from it.
Update :- one can update .json file and update json data in it.
Delete :- one can delete .json file and delete json data in it.

## Requirements
1. Be able to create a file.(any)
2. Import json.
3. Using json.dump() and json.load() to create and read.json file.

## Code explanation 
1. In create.py 2 json files are created.
2. In read.py the files created are read and the data is printed.
3. In update.py the files created are read and the data is updated. 
In data.json age is changed to 31.
