## Intro 
Json is a good data format for interchange across systems. 
It makes it possible for apis that maybe built in different prog languages be able to communicate.
In this repo I do Showcase the ability of Python to deal with Json data.  

## CRUD operation 
Create :- one can create a .json file and add json data into it.
Read :- one can read .json file and get json data from it.
Update :- one can update .json file and update json data in it.
Delete :- one can delete .json file and delete json data in it.

2. Import json.
3. Using json.dump() and json.load() to create and read.json file.
